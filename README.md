# VocabularyTest
A small program that helps you to practice vocabularies of any language.

The program is made by C++. Currently it is designed for Japanese-Taiwanese Mandarin (or Chinese, FYI), but it should be used for any other language as long as you create your own database.

It has some problems now, such as some vocabularies with more than one way to be read have only one correct answer.

For instance,
- 四(four) can be よん(yonn) or し(shi), but currently it can only be the former. 

Still searching way to fix it.
